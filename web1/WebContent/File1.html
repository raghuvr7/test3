Every since we published our Moto G 3rd gen review, 
several users have written to us asking which smartphone
should they buy - Motorola's latest offering in India
or the Xiaomi Mi 4i. The 2GB RAM + 16GB internal storage
variants of the two smartphones cost an identical Rs. 12,999,
so comparisons between the two are understandable. 
We put the Xiaomi Mi 4i and Motorola's Moto G 3rd gen head 
to head.
