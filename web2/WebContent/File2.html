<p>In terms of build quality, there are no major issues with either phone.
We personally like the grip that the Moto G 3rd gen offers compared to the Mi 4i,
but you may prefer the clean design of the Xiaomi. Both phones come with a non removable battery.
The Xiaomi Mi 4i is noticeably lighter and sleeker than the Moto G 3rd gen, 
so if that's important to you, you know which one to pick.
